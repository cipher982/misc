# Transformer Intuition Lab

**Educational toolkit that exposes transformer math and computationâ€”no black boxes.**

## Philosophy
- **Transparency over performance**: Show every operation explicitly
- **Loops over vectorization**: Reveal mechanics rather than hide them
- **Single implementation**: Avoid factories/backends that obscure understanding
- **Educational errors**: Clear messages that teach, not frustrate

## Architecture Evolution
- **Current focus**: Simplified educational implementations
- **Legacy**: `transformerlab/` multi-backend kept for reference but de-emphasized due to complexity
- **Direction**: Moving toward maximum clarity for learning

## Development
- **Python 3.13 only**: Modern syntax throughout
- **uv managed**: Dependencies, formatting, linting unified
- **Test-driven**: Emphasize mathematical correctness over speed
